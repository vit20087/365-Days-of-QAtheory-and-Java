3. **Methods and Functions**  
   * *Creating Methods*: Learn how to define and call methods (functions) to break down tasks.
   * *Parameters and Return Types*: Understand how to pass data into methods and return results.
   * *Practice*: Create methods on [W3Schools - Java Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp).

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   * *Classes and Objects*: Discover how to create classes and objects for organizing code.
   * *Key OOP Principles*: Learn about inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
   * *Practice*: Review OOP basics on [W3Schools - Java OOP](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp).

5. **Java Data Structures (Arrays and Strings)**  
   * *Arrays*: Understand how to create and use arrays for storing multiple values.
   * *Strings*: Learn Java’s `String` class and common operations (concatenation, comparison, splitting).
   * *Practice*: Data structure exercises on [W3Schools - Java Arrays](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_arrays.asp) and [Java Strings](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_strings.asp).

6. **Exception Handling**  
   * *Error Management*: Handle exceptions with `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks to manage errors in test scripts.
   * *Practice*: Practice exception handling on [W3Schools - Java Exception Handling](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_try_catch.asp).

7. **File Input and Output (I/O)**  
   * *Reading and Writing Files*: Learn file handling techniques in Java, useful for reading test data and writing test results.
   * *Practice*: Explore file I/O basics on [W3Schools - Java File Handling](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_files.asp).

### Additional Practice Resources
* **Java Basics**: Interactive exercises on [W3Schools Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/).
* **Coding Challenges**: More structured Java challenges on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/10-days-of-java).

This first month will establish a solid Java foundation to prepare you for automation tasks with Selenium and TestNG.

### Month 2: Manual Testing and Advanced Java

#### Goal: Build manual testing skills and dive into advanced Java to support automation.

* **Week 5: Manual Testing Skills**
  * Practice creating and executing test cases, planning tests, and logging defects.
  * Use JIRA to document and track defect life cycles.

* **Weeks 6-8: Advanced Java**
  * Explore Java Collections (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap) for data handling.
  * Study exception handling and Java I/O to read and manage test data.

### Month 3: Selenium WebDriver and TestNG Framework

#### Goal: Start automating web applications and learn structured testing with TestNG.

* **Week 9: Selenium WebDriver Basics**
  * Set up Selenium WebDriver and learn to locate elements using XPath, CSS selectors, etc.
  * Practice automating actions like form submissions, button clicks, and page navigation.

* **Weeks 10-11: Advanced Selenium**
  * Work with dropdowns, alerts, iFrames, multiple windows, and waits for reliable test scripts.
  * Create scripts to manage data-driven tests.

* **Weeks 12-13: TestNG Framework**
  * Set up TestNG and learn test structure using annotations, assertions, and parameterization.
  * Organize tests into suites, and practice using TestNG reports.

---

### Month 4: Automation Framework Design and API Testing

#### Goal: Develop a modular automation framework and learn API testing.

* **Weeks 14-15: Test Automation Framework Design**
  * Implement the Page Object Model (POM) for maintainable scripts.
  * Organize your framework with reusable methods, test data, configurations, and reporting.

* **Weeks 16-17: API Testing with RestAssured**
  * Set up RestAssured and perform CRUD operations on REST APIs.
  * Validate JSON responses, and integrate API tests with your Selenium framework for end-to-end test coverage.
